# **Machine Learning for Predicting Aerosol Mixed Layer Heights**
## By: Julianna Christopoulos


# **Overview**

This project is dedicated to the estimation of mixed layer heights (MLH) within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) through the utilization of datasets obtained from NASA Langley's airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs). The primary objective is to enhance MLH retrieval by employing a supervised machine learning approach, specifically utilizing regression ensemble learning. Leveraging data from two recent lidar field campaigns, the project seeks to automate MLH predictions for test flights, showcasing a notable improvement in performance when compared to existing methodologies. To ensure the algorithm's robustness and automation, ongoing efforts involve further refinement and evaluation, particularly in addressing complex lidar scenes.
