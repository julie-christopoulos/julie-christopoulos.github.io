##  **Project Title : Machine Learning for Predicting Aerosol Mixed Layer Heights**

# **Overview**

This project focuses on enhancing the estimation of mixed layer height (MLH) in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) using datasets derived from NASA Langley's airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs). The project aims to automate MLH retrieval by applying a supervised machine learning approach, with regression ensemble learning. Two recent lidar field campaigns are used to predict MLHs for test flights, showing improved performance compared to the existing method. Further refinement and evaluation on complex lidar scenes are needed for a more robust and automated MLH algorithm.
