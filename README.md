# **Machine Learning for Predicting Aerosol Mixed Layer Heights**
## By: Julianna Christopoulos


### **Overview**

This project is aims to predict aerosol mixed layer heights (MLH) through the utilization of datasets obtained from NASA Langley's airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs). The primary objective is to enhance the current MLH algorithm by employing a supervised machine learning approach, specifically with regression ensemble learning. Leveraging data from two recent lidar field campaigns, the project seeks to automate MLH predictions for test flights, illustrating a notable improvement in performance when compared to the existing method. To ensure the algorithm's robustness and automation, ongoing efforts hope to include further refinement and evaluation, particularly in addressing more complex MLH scenes.
